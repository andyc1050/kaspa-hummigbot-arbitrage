strategy: amm_arb

# Primary Exchange (Market 1)
connector_1: kucoin
market_1: KAS-USDT

# Secondary Exchange (Market 2)
connector_2: kraken
market_2: KAS-USDT

# Trading Parameters
# ------------------

# Amount of KAS to trade per arbitrage
# Start small for testing (50-100 KAS)
# Scale up gradually as you gain confidence
order_amount: 100.0

# Minimum profitability threshold (0.5% = 0.005)
# This is the minimum profit required after fees to execute trade
# Recommended: 0.003-0.008 (0.3%-0.8%)
# Lower = more trades but less profit per trade
# Higher = fewer trades but more profit per trade
min_profitability: 0.005

# Slippage buffer for Market 1 (KuCoin)
# This accounts for price movement during order execution
# Recommended: 0.001-0.002 (0.1%-0.2%)
market_1_slippage_buffer: 0.001

# Slippage buffer for Market 2 (Kraken)
# Adjust based on exchange liquidity
# Higher liquidity = lower buffer needed
market_2_slippage_buffer: 0.001

# Concurrent orders submission
# true = submit buy and sell orders simultaneously (faster, riskier)
# false = wait for first order to fill before submitting second (slower, safer)
# Recommended: true for high liquidity pairs
concurrent_orders_submission: true

# Optional Parameters
# --------------------

# Uncomment and adjust as needed:

# Maximum time to keep orders open before cancelling (in seconds)
# order_refresh_time: 30.0

# Enable debug mode (only check for arbitrage, don't execute)
# debug_mode: false

# Enable rate oracle
# use_rate_oracle: false

# Trading fee override (if different from exchange default)
# taker_fee: 0.001  # 0.1%

# Notes:
# ------
# 1. Ensure you have sufficient balance on BOTH exchanges
#    - KuCoin needs USDT for buying KAS
#    - Kraken needs KAS for selling
# 
# 2. Check trading pair format on each exchange:
#    - Some use KAS-USDT
#    - Others use KAS/USDT
#    - Verify in exchange documentation
#
# 3. Monitor your first trades closely
#    - Use paper trading mode first to test
#    - Start with small amounts
#    - Check logs for errors
#
# 4. Rebalance regularly
#    - Move funds between exchanges as needed
#    - Maintain 50/50 split of USDT and KAS on each
